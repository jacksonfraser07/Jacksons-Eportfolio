        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>For this design project, my team and I created a Universal Cable with Attachable Heads, which is a charging cable designed to cut down on e-waste and make charging easier for users. Instead of owning many different cables, the user keeps one main cable and swaps out small magnetic tips depending on the device they want to charge. Our design focused on using recycled materials, such as repurposed cable shells and reused internal wiring, to support a more sustainable/circular system. We also looked at safety and durability by adding features like self-aligning magnets, overheat protection to prevent damage and make the cable longer lasting. Throughout the project, we studied possible risks—like overheating, magnet misalignment, and manufacturing challenges, and created strategies to reduce these issues. We also looked at the full life cycle of the product, from how materials are collected to how the cable can be reused or recycled at the end of its life. Overall, this project helped me build skills in teamwork, design thinking, sustainability, and risk analysis, and it taught me how important it is to balance safety with user needs and environmental impacts.</p>
