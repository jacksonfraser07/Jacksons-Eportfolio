        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>My biggest programming project was a fully playable 3D racing game built in Java. I created the entire game environment using P3D, which meant learning how to work in three dimensions, manage camera movement, and control objects in 3D space. I researched and used PVectors to handle the car’s acceleration, velocity, direction, and movement, and I designed a first-person camera system that follows the player smoothly as they drive. I also created the track and car models using Blender, then imported them into my program with PShapes. A lot of time went into getting the physics right, such as drifting, falling off the track, collision detection using hundreds of hitboxes, and making the game feel challenging but fair. This project pushed me to troubleshoot on my own, especially with transformations like pushMatrix and popMatrix, and it helped me grow as a programmer. In the end, the game ran smoothly, looked clean, and was fun to play, and it remains the projects I’m most proud of in my life thus far.
