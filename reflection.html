            <h2>Course Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the course of APSC 169, I learned that the process of designing something meaningful is not a straight road, and requires lots of planning, analysis, iteration, and most importantly, an open mind. Our design project showed me how important it is to clearly define the problem, explore multiple ideas, and be willing to change direction when something does not work as expected. I also saw how prototypes and sketches help turn abstract ideas into something concrete that a team can discuss, improve, and iterate upon. For example, during the C-sketches of our group, we ended up drawing the product we chose for our most novel solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on my experience, the most important attributes of an engineer include curiosity, communication, and responsibility. Curiosity drives the search for better solutions, communication allows engineers to work effectively with their peers, and responsibility keeps the focus on safety and ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on the project helped me understand a glimpse of the role of the professional engineer as someone who balances technical details with human needs and environmental impacts. Even a simple object like a charging cable has the possibility for iteration in terms of waste management, accessibility and user efficiency. This expanded my view of engineering and made me proud that this is the direction that I am willing to take with my life.
            </p>
            <p>
            Through this course, I learned that some of my strengths are teamwork, organization, and being willing to revise my work after feedback. I also realized that I need to continue developing my confidence in speaking aloud. I would also like to work on my modelling skills because most of it looks very interesting and difficult to me. To grow in these areas, I plan to practice more with design software, seek feedback from instructors and peers, and use future projects as chances to push myself beyond my comfort zone.
            </p>
            <p>
            In all, I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and I am excited to pursue more open-ended projects in the future.
