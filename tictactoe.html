        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>For one of my early programming projects, I created a Tic Tac Toe game to practice building my coding skills in a fun way. This project helped me learn how to handle player turns, check win conditions, and design a simple but functional user interface for a type-line program. I focused on making the game easy to understand and bug-free by organizing the code clearly and testing every possible game outcome using the least amount of code as possible, including ties, invalid moves and invalid input characters. Even though it was a smaller project, it played a big role in helping me understand how to break problems into smaller steps, plan out the logic before coding, and write cleaner, more efficient code. It also helped build the foundation for the larger projects I created later on. In fact, I revisited this project earlier this year and implemented code to act as an opponent for single-player gameplay. This took a lot of effort to figure out how to code in a way that allows a user to play against a computer that can readjust based on the user's moves.
